# JavaFX-MySQL-Project

A project where an airport management system case study was developed for an University OOP class.

The program stores any relevant data in a MySQL database created on the first startup, using DAO and JPA principles for Java data manipulation.
To maintain a good UX, the UI is developed using CSS (through JavaFX) for styling and implements Humanâ€“Computer Interaction principles such as, but not limited to, feedback, simplicity and visibility.

Developed using JDK18, JavaFX, Scene Builder, MySQL and NetBeans.
