# JavaFX-MySQL-Project

[Link para README em português](../master/README.br.md)

A project where an airport management system case study was developed for an University OOP class.

The program stores any relevant data in a MySQL database created on the first startup, using DAO and JPA principles for Java data manipulation.
To maintain a good UX, the UI is developed using CSS (through JavaFX) for styling and implements Human–Computer Interaction principles such as, but not limited to, feedback, simplicity and visibility.

Developed using JDK18, JavaFX, Scene Builder, MySQL and NetBeans.
